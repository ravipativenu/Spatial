## Description
In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to integrate S/4HANA and ESRI GIS data at the data level. This integrated data will be consumed in SAP Analytics Cloud.

* In S/4HANA CDS views are created to combine customer sales, product, and location information
* The Data Provisioning Agent is installed and the ABAP adapter is registered with the SAP HANA system
* A Remote Connection is made from the HANA system to the S/4HANA system
* Virtual Tables of the S/4HANA CDS views are created
* In HANA the virtual tables from the S/4HANA data are combined with spatial tables in calculation views for consumption
