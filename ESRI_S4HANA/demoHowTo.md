## Description
In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to integrate S/4HANA and ESRI GIS data at the data level. This integrated data can be consumed in SAP Analytics Cloud.

<img src="images/s4HpEsriDemoSAC01.jpg">


## Overview

* In S/4HANA CDS views are created to combine customer sales, product, and location information
* The Data Provisioning Agent is installed and the ABAP adapter is registered with the SAP HANA system
* A Remote Connection is made from the HANA system to the S/4HANA system
* Virtual Tables of the S/4HANA CDS views are created
* In HANA the virtual tables from the S/4HANA data are combined with spatial tables in calculation views for consumption

## Target group

* Data analysts and developers
* People interested in learning about extending S/4HANA with ESRI spatial data  


## Prerequisites
  
Here is a list of the equipment prerequisites for this exercise. A link to the prerequisites page is further below.

* A fully activated S/4HANA on premise trial system
* An SAP HANA system (for this exercise we can use the HANA database on the S/4HANA system)
* An SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) account
* A configured connection from the SAC tenant to the HANA system (we will use SDI's Data Provisioning and Remote Sources)

Here are the knowledge prerequisites for this exercise.

* Familiarity with ABAP CDS views in S/4HANA
* Familiarity with Calculation views in SAP HANA
* Familiarity with Story design in SAP Analytics Cloud

### <a name="cdsview1"></a> Creation of CDS View with Customer Sales, Products, and Location

The first CDS view that needs to be created will include sales amounts by customer > location > product. In your Eclipse ABAP project create a new CDS view with the following information.

```
Name = ZXSH_C_SALESORDERITEMFSZ
Description = Public Consumption View, Z Copy Sales Order Item
```

<img src="images/s4HpEsriDemoPics01.jpg">

Copy the following code into the view editor. You can substitute the "SH" in ZXSH to match your namespace.
	
```
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZXSHCSLSORDITFSZ'
@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@ClientHandling.algorithm: #SESSION_VARIABLE
@EndUserText.label: 'Z Copy Sales Order Item'
@VDM.viewType: #CONSUMPTION

define view ZXSH_C_SALESORDERITEMFSZ as select from C_Salesorderitemfs
left outer join I_Customer
    on C_Salesorderitemfs.ShipToParty = I_Customer.Customer
left outer join I_Address
    on I_Customer.AddressID = I_Address.AddressID
{
    Customer,
    CustomerName,
    SalesOrder,
    RequestedDeliveryDate,
    SalesOrderItem,
    SalesOrderItemText,
    NetAmount,
    TransactionCurrency,
    RequestedQuantity,
    I_Address.AddressID,
    I_Address.AddressTimeZone,
    I_Address.CityName,
    I_Address.District,
    I_Address.Region,
    I_Address.County,
    I_Address.PostalCode
}
```

### <a name="cdsview2"></a> Creation of CDS View with Customer Location

The second CDS view that needs to be created will be a customer location hierarchy. This hierarchical data will be used later on in the SAP Analytics Cloud for the mapping component. In your Eclipse ABAP project create a new CDS view with the following information.

```
Name = ZXSH_C_CUSTOMERGEO
Description = Public Consumption View, Customer Location Hierarchy
```

<img src="images/s4HpEsriDemoPics02.jpg">

Copy the following code into the view editor. You can substitute the "SH" in ZXSH to match your namespace.

```
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZXSHCCUSTOMERGEO'
@ClientHandling.algorithm: #SESSION_VARIABLE
@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: 'customer geo data for location hierarchy'
@VDM.viewType: #CONSUMPTION

define view ZXSH_C_CUSTOMERGEO as select from I_Customer 
inner join I_Address
    on I_Customer.AddressID = I_Address.AddressID
{
   I_Customer.Customer as LHCustomer,
   I_Address.AddressID as LHAddressID, 
   I_Address.AddressTimeZone as LHAddressTimeZone, 
   I_Address.CityName as LHCityName,
   I_Address.District as LHDistrict,
   I_Address.Region as LHRegion,
   I_Address.County as LHCounty,
   I_Address.Country as LHCountry,
   I_Address.PostalCode as LHPostalCode
}
```

### <a name="remotecon"></a> Setup of Remote Connection and Virtual Tables for the S/4HANA System

In order to connect your SAP HANA system to your S/4HANA system you need to first set up the Data Provisioning Agent.  
https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/ > click on the Cloud Integration tab > scroll down to the Data Integration Downloads section.

* Note that this download is only for dev/testing purposes. Please contact your SAP representative for licensing of this product on a production system.

### <a name="remotecon"></a> Setup of Sample Database for the SAP HANA System

XXXXXX need steps and video links etc.	

In the next steps we will create a HANA database user that has the rights to create remote connections and tables, import objects, create Calculation Views, etc.
