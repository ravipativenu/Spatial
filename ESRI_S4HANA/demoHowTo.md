## Description
In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to integrate S/4HANA and ESRI GIS data at the data level. This integrated data will be consumed in SAP Analytics Cloud.

<img src="images/s4HpEsriDemoArch02.jpg">    

* In S/4HANA CDS views are created to combine customer sales, product, and location information
* The Data Provisioning Agent is installed and the ABAP adapter is registered with the SAP HANA system
* A Remote Connection is made from the HANA system to the S/4HANA system
* Virtual Tables of the S/4HANA CDS views are created
* In HANA the virtual tables from the S/4HANA data are combined with spatial tables in calculation views for consumption

## Target group

* Data analysts and developers
* People interested in learning about extending S/4HANA with ESRI spatial data  


## Prerequisites
  
Here are the prerequisites for this exercise.

* A fully activated S/4HANA on premise trial system
* A technical S/4HANA user with appropriate roles (see below)
* An SAP HANA on premise system
* An SAP HANA technical user with appropriate rights (see below)
* An Eclipse IDE with HANA and ABAP tools installed

The S/4HANA trial system can be found at the [SAP Cloud Appliance Library.](https://cal.sap.com/console/tenant_5XPSH094G71U#/solutions/4dd49282-86ec-4e78-8b40-ef0c237012fa) If you are using the trial appliance then the appropriate user for this exercise is S4H_SD_DEM. Please see the Welcome page on the Windows Remote Desktop included with the appliance. 

Business Roles for the S/4HANA technical user (S4H_SD_DEM) include:
* SAP_BR_SALES_MANAGER
* SAP_BR_PRODMASTER_SPECIALIST

Note that the appliance Windows machine includes a configured Eclipse IDE with the needed tools for ABAP CDS development installed. If you are interested in learning more about how to set up your own Eclipse environment, please see the downloads and instructions for ABAP and HANA tools for Eclipse at https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/
